# MADE push-pull code
The following is the code for: 
1. Creating high resolution hydraulic conductivity field
2. Averaging high resolution hydraulic conductivity field and adding vadose zone.
3. Input scripts for running Parflow creating pressure files throughout the push-pull test.
4. Slim-FAST input scripts for the injection, wait, and extraction, periods
5. Input files for PEST optimization for both the ADE and t-fADE models.
